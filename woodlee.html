      <p class="infotext" style="font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> <span>Woodlee primarily serves as our sports facility, dedicated to physical health education (PHE) during school hours. If you have a PHE class, you'll find yourself in this building, where you should turn left upon entering to access a corridor. Follow this corridor to its end, make a right, and then a left to discover the changing rooms. In this area, there's a whiteboard with instructions, so it's a good idea to change into your sports attire first and then review the directions to be fully prepared. After school hours, Woodlee transforms into a vibrant hub for various extracurricular activities. Typically, participation in these activities requires changing into appropriate sports attire and joining your chosen activity. For those seeking a snack, there's a snack shop conveniently located on the top floor; however, please note that it's only open after school. For any inquiries related to after-school activities, you can turn to Mr. Jonestones, who heads our co-curricular activities. His office is situated on the top floor, near the entrance stairs. In addition to sports-related activities, you'll also find classrooms towards the back of Woodlee's top floor. It's worth mentioning that this venue also plays host to whole-school assemblies, but please remember not to leave any belongings in the changing rooms, as they may be locked at times.
